Today, I started exploring a new technology. The goal is to understand how version control systems work and how to use Git and GitHub for managing code. My immediate plans are:

Learn basic Git commands.
Create a few test repositories.
Practice making commits and pushing changes to GitHub.
Familiarize myself with pull requests and how to use them in team collaboration.
This might be the beginning of a long and exciting journey filled with new knowledge and opportunities!
